### Overview

Gyromina is a multipurpose Discord bot, made to be a fun and functional addition to any Discord server.

Gyromina contains an assortment of features, including a random colour and number generator, a unit converter, a library of minigames, a custom poll creator, miscellaneous fun commands, and more!

### Events + Seasons üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

Occasionally, Gyromina will get some special features and UI changes during certain events throughout the year!

The **pride** event is currently active and will remain active throughout the month of June!  
Gyromina was created by an openly LGBTQIA+ creator who is absolutely proud to be who they are and eternally grateful to be residing in an accepting area of the world. As a show of support for the LGBTQIA+ community, Gyromina will don a rainbow profile picture and have some special easter eggs enabled.
