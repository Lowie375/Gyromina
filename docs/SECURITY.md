# Security Policy

As Gyromina is a publicly-usable Discord bot, I take its issues (especially those involving security) very seriously. All it takes is one error or breach for Gyromina to come crashing down, so I strive to prevent each new release from being exploitable.

Only the current stable minor version (`x.minor.x`) and indev versions (`x.x.x-alpha/beta.x`) will receive security patches. Old versions will be left "as-is" for simplicity's sake, since differences between older and newer verisons of Gyromina's code may result in patch incompatibility.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please email me at lowie375@gmail.com, explaining the vulnerability in-depth (similar to how you would in a bug report, see the template [here](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)). Be sure to include "Gyromina Security" in the email's subject line, that way I know this is a serious matter and I can get to work on a patch ASAP.

While preparing a patch, I may ask for more information about the vulnerability. Please try to answer all of these requests to the best of your ability.
