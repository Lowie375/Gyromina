**Bug description**

Briefly explain what you were trying to do with Gyromina, and what happened. Go into as much detail as necessary.

**Screenshot**

Take a screenshot of what caused the error, along with any additional consequences, and attach it to the report. This lets me see exactly what happened.

**Reference code**

Most of the time, errors will cause a small embed box will pop up with a link to the bug reporting page and a 16-digit reference code. They look something like this:

The part circled in red is the **reference code**. If you have any, post them somewhere inside your bug report. I can use them to find logs for each error, which help me get a better understanding of what went wrong.

*If there aren't any reference codes associated with your bug, add "No reference code" or something similar to your bug report so that I know.*

**Patterns**

If you noticed any patterns in unexpected behaviour, add them. They may help me find and fix the root of the problem.

**Additional context**

Add any other context about the problem here.
